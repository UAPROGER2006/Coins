This game on p5.js implements a player, an enemy pursuer, and a coin.
The enemy starts at a speed of 120 px/sec and gradually gets faster: every +5 points add +10 px/sec to its speed. If the enemy
touches the player, the game ends with a Game Over message and the option to restart with the R key.
When collecting coins, the player receives a point and a short sound effect plays. 
Controls are via the arrow keys or WASD, with movement normalized to fps. 
Next, you can add several types of enemies, obstacles, records, and visual effects for greater dynamics.
